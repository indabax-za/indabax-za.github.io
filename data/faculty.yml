      "A recent report issued by the WWF states that there has been a catastrophic decline in wildlife population in recent years. A large number of species are threatened with extinction due to a number of factors such as over-exploitation of resources, deforestation and climate change. Certain species have been placed on the IUCN Red List for several years, but further conservation efforts are still urgently required to ensure the survival of the remaining individuals. While it is true that the number of individuals in threatened populations is decreasing, there have been considerable conservation efforts to put a halt to this. Ecologists, researchers, and rangers closely monitor the populations, in certain cases by placing microphones, camera-traps, and other sensors into the environment and searching through the recorded data for the species of interest. These data collection methodologies comes with a cost, in that huge datasets (audio, image, accelerometery) are produced and are difficult to manually process. This keynote will discuss our group's efforts in using deep learning to monitor critically endangered species in Africa and around our planet, and hopefully encourage you to do the same."

    talk_description:
      "While reinforcement learning has achieved recent success in many challenging domains, these methods generally require millions of samples from the environment to learn optimal behaviours, limiting their real-world applicability. A major challenge is thus in designing sample-efficient agents that can transfer their existing knowledge to solve new tasks quickly. This is particularly important for agents in a multitask or lifelong setting, since learning to solve complex tasks from scratch is typically impractical. This talk discusses how an agent can autonomously learn a particular family of goal-oriented value functions, which can then be used to solve new tasks through composition. First, for goal-reaching tasks expressible as Boolean sentences, we show how these value functions can be combined to solve these new tasks optimally. We further demonstrate how an agent can combine these value functions to produce near-optimal behaviours given complex temporal task specifications, such as regular fragments of linear temporal logic, without further learning."

    talk_description:
      "The Internet has evolved into a universal platform for all forms of modern communication. Initially, it was constructed on the principle of an intelligent edge and a core dump, utilizing a best-effort routing model that enabled it to scale massively and support hundreds of millions of nodes. The shift towards a more intelligent Internet began with the introduction of virtualization and the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, which successfully separated the control and data planes. A major advancement was achieved with the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into networking through the Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN) paradigm, allowing networks to extract valuable insights from data process
Building on this foundation, Knowledge-Aware Networking (KAN) introduces a ground-breaking paradigm that utilizes multi-controller SDN architectures to create innovative learning models for cooperative, competitive, and diverse environments. This approach aims to significantly enhance security, resilience, and intelligence within the network. In KAN, cooperative learning employs the Federated Learning model, where multiple clients collaboratively train machine learning models. Competitive learning involves choosing the most suitable model for a particular use case from a pool of models. Diversity learning replicates the same model across different servers and uses a voting mechanism to ensure fault tolerance.
Knowledge-Aware Networking holds the potential to redefine the landscape of networking, embedding intelligence, efficiency, and robustness into the core of our communication infrastructure. This keynote is dedicated to elucidating the transformative impact of artificial intelligence on networking, emphasizing the transition from traditional best-effort approaches to the more sophisticated realm of knowledge-aware networking. Throughout this presentation, we will delve into the intricacies of the KAN architecture, unravelling its layers and exploring the myriad learning models it accommodates. Moreover, we will examine how KAN empowers networks to operate with greater intelligence and autonomy, facilitated by collaborative, competitive, and diversity learning.

    talk_description: "In this talk I will present our workshop paper “Optimal Task Generalisation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning” which will be appearing at the CoCoMARL workshop being held at RLC 2024. In this paper we present a method for provably optimal task generalisation in multi-agent reinforcement learning, which to the best of our knowledge is the first work to do so.
Multi-agent systems where multiple agents must collaborate to achieve multiple tasks are ubiquitous in real world applications. A notable example of this is automated warehouse where multiple autonomous robots must navigate to, and transport assigned shelves. In many situations there are common properties across tasks leading to the possibility of shared knowledge, such as in automated warehouses where the layout of the warehouse and robots do not change but the desired shelves do. In this work we consider goal-oriented tasks where each agent has a set of goals (terminal states) they wish to reach, and each goal has an associated terminal reward.  We propose a method Goal-Oriented Learning for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (GOLeMM) that explicitly learns a goal-oriented value function that provably encodes how each agent can optimally achieve every goal. This goal-oriented value function is learnt from a single arbitrary task and afterwards this information is used to optimally infer without further learning any other task in the distribution given only knowledge of the terminal rewards. 
Empirically we demonstrate that given a fixed step quota our method is able to optimally generalise over a full task distribution while representative methods can only learn a small fraction with the gap between our method and those increasing exponentially as the number of goals in the environment increases.

    talk_description: "Title: Comparative Analysis of Wind Speed Probability Distributions for Wind Energy Potential in Nigeria
Abstract: This study aims to compare the performance of various probability density functions, including the conventional Weibull, normal, log-normal, and gamma distributions, with the mixture Weibull distribution, in assessing the wind energy potential across different locations in Nigeria. Utilizing 20 years (1995-2015) of wind speed data from 12 meteorological stations—two from each of the six geopolitical zones—the analysis reveals significant findings.
Key Findings:
•	The mixture Weibull distribution demonstrated superior fitting accuracy for wind speed data in most stations, outperforming other distributions based on statistical error metrics such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
•	The mixture Weibull distribution effectively captured the bimodal nature of wind speed distributions in several locations, a feature inadequately represented by the conventional Weibull function.
•	Northern regions of Nigeria generally exhibited higher wind speeds compared to southern regions, with Lagos displaying the highest average monthly wind speed of 12.71 m/s, and Owerri, also in the southern part, showing the lowest at 2.68 m/s.
•	The spatial variability of wind resources across Nigeria was highlighted by the mixture Weibull parameters, with the shape parameter (α) ranging from 3.98 to 15.71 and the scale parameter (β) from 3.00 to 12.29 m/s.
Conclusion: The findings from this study provide valuable insights for wind energy resource assessment and the development of appropriate wind energy technologies in Nigeria, accounting for the unique wind regimes across different regions. This comprehensive analysis not only advances the understanding of wind energy potential but also informs strategic planning for sustainable energy development in Nigeria.

    talk_description: "The modern mining industrial sector greatly depends on an efficient maintenance plan to achieve maximum failure prevention, and a plethora of innovative solutions have been developed to enhance and optimize this endeavor. However, newer plants with complex technologies are built every day and the experience or failure history needed to predict equipment performance, reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) especially at the infant stage of their operation is predominantly scarce. To curtail this challenge, an early life RAM study can be adopted, serving a proactive maintenance strategy implemented to optimize the overall lifespan of the system by addressing and resolving early failures and potential future threats. In this research, a discrete event(failure)-based Monte Carlo simulation is used to model a Sulphur dioxide (SO2) abatement plant as a case study in South Africa. The result of the simulation predicts the worst case and best-case scenario of the plant’s condition, number of failures, downtime contributors, reliability and availability for the next 6 years. Furthermore, reliability centered maintenance is implemented on the most critical identified subcomponents and a task list is developed and packaged to form part of the maintenance plan needed to improve the SO2 abatement plant’s health condition. The research shows that numerous complex maintenance challenges of various plants including mining, oil and gas, aviation etc. can be solved using an effective simulation tool which leads to high business productivity, safety and profitability."

    talk_description: "My master's research focused on explaining several convolutional neural networks using a novel scheme called GradSUM to explain models trained to predict steering angle in a self-driving vehicle from forward facing images. This scheme makes use of a gradient map generated using the GradCAM algorithm and a ground truth dataset which contains semantic segmentations that can be used to correlate the gradient maps to relevant parts of the input data.

Our results show that different trained CNN architectures perform differently and that GradSUM is an effective tool for discerning points of interest from the input data which can help determine those behaviours.

The cutting edge research focuses on transformers as a replacement for more traditional neural network architectures. These transformers make use of attribution maps which can be treated in a similar manner as a gradient map. This opens up multiple ways to apply GradSUM with generated gradient maps and the already existing attribution maps to attempt to describe the behaviours of these AI architectures.

Expanding this work beyond computer vision problems is also possible. However this requires generating new ground truth datasets and also handling the interpolation steps normally done with image problems slightly differently to handle the dimensional structures present in those other areas of study.

This proposed analysis scheme shows promise in helping to explain AI architectures. However it does come with some trade-offs including added complexity, the requirement for a new high quality ground truth dataset, and added computation. Our hope is to publish our expanded results and expand the work further into new domains to determine how extensible we can make this scheme. "
