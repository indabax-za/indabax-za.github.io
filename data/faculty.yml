    talk_description: "As Artificial Intelligence continues to progress, the underlying architectures that support learning across distributed, privacy-sensitive environments must also evolve. “Federated Learning (FL)” has emerged as a powerful framework for privacy-preserving, decentralized model training. However, its conventional implementation assumes homogeneous data distributions and identical model architectures across all clients—assumptions that rarely hold in real-world scenarios. This talk introduces the concept of “Diversity Learning” within federated architectures. In this approach, clients are grouped into clusters based on the nature of their data and operational roles. Each cluster is trained using a model architecture best suited to its specific context—whether temporal, spatial, or multi-modal—giving rise to the “Federated Diversity Learning (FedDivL)” paradigm. FedDivL embraces both data and model heterogeneity, enabling more flexible and context-aware learning. However, this diversity introduces new challenges in aggregating knowledge across heterogeneous clusters. To overcome these, FedDivL requires the development of “adaptive fusion strategies” that move beyond conventional averaging techniques. These strategies enable more informed and reliable global decision-making. Selected fusion strategies will be presented in this talk. Through use cases in network intrusion detection (e.g., SDN-based DDoS attacks) and smart infrastructure systems, the talk will demonstrate how diversity-aware federated learning enhances system robustness, adaptability, and generalization—particularly in dynamic and resource-constrained environments. Participants will gain insight into the limitations of traditional FL and explore how embracing diversity in both data and model design can unlock the next generation of collaborative, intelligent systems."

This talk explores how we can build a thriving data culture that empowers students, educators, and institutions to confidently navigate, question, and use data in meaningful ways. Across Africa, data is being generated at an unprecedented rate - from mobile usage to education and health systems - but much of it remains underutilised or misunderstood. This is not about tools or platforms - it is about cultivating data thinking: the mindset to ask the right questions, spot patterns, and make informed decisions. Join us for an interactive and engaging session packed with real-world examples, bold ideas, and practical ways to turn data into meaningful impact."

    talk_description: "The historical foundations of artificial intelligence (AI) are strongly based on formal symbolic logics, especially first-order logic. Although statistical, sub-symbolic methods have gained prominence in the last two decades, research in symbolic method have continued and there have been many significant contributions based on symbolic methods. There has also been much progress in applying machine learning (ML) techniques to symbolically represented knowledge. In recent years, neuro-symbolic (NeSy) methods have gained much research interest. NeSy attempts to combine the power of ML, especially neural networks, with the precision, compactness and the power of logical reasoning. In this talk, I'll discuss these themes and related topics, like inductive logic programming, dynamic Bayesian networks and symbolic reinforcement learning."
    bio: "Gavin Rens received his Doctoral degree from the University of KwaZulu-Natal in 2015. He then took post-doctoral fellowships at UKZN, the University of Cape Town and the KU Leuven university in Belgium, before joining the academic staff of the Computer Science division of Stellenbosch University. For his doctoral research, Gavin developed a logical language for representing and reasoning about partially observable Markov decision processes. Much of his early postdoc work involved probabilistic and logic-based belief-change theory. Later, as a postdoc and more recently, Gavin has done research in probabilistic planning and reinforcement learning. He also has an interest in agent architectures and has a few publications on the topic."

    talk_description: "This research introduces ForecastRL, a novel deep learning framework that integrates neural time series forecasting with risk-aware reinforcement learning for financial trading. Our key contribution is a unified architecture that enables bidirectional information flow between predictive and decision-making components through a custom ForecastAugmentedRLEnv that injects forecasting outputs directly into the RL state space. We implement multiple neural forecasting models (NBEATSx, NHITS, LSTM, RNN, MLP) combined with policy gradient methods (PPO) and value-based approaches (DQN, A2C), enhanced by a risk preference system that implements different investor utility functions through parameterized reward shaping. This work contributes to deep learning research by demonstrating how to effectively combine temporal prediction models with sequential decision-making systems, with practical applications in quantitative finance and algorithmic trading."
    bio: "I am a Software Engineer and graduate researcher with experience designing and deploying enterprise-grade fintech applications. My research focuses on the intersection of behavioral finance, neural forecasting, and reinforcement learning, developing novel frameworks for risk-aware autonomous trading systems that integrate investor risk preferences (risk-averse, risk-neutral, risk-loving) into reinforcement learning algorithms through sophisticated utility functions and risk-adjusted reward mechanisms. I'm passionate about translating cutting-edge research into real-world impact, particularly in developing autonomous decision-making systems that can model human behavioral biases and preferences. My work bridges the gap between behavioral finance theory and practical algorithmic trading, contributing to both academic understanding and industry applications in quantitative finance, portfolio optimization, and risk management."

    talk_description: "Title: Ethics in the Age of AI: Balancing Privacy, Accuracy, and Access\nSpeaker: Prof. Marlene Holmner, Department of Information Science, University of Pretoria\n\nAs Artificial Intelligence becomes increasingly embedded in everyday life—shaping decisions, driving innovation, and redefining information systems—it also brings forth complex ethical dilemmas. This keynote explores the critical ethical dimensions of AI with a specific focus on privacy, accuracy, intellectual property, access, and security in the context of generative AI tools and large language models.\n\nDrawing from real-world examples, pending global lawsuits, and emerging African AI policy frameworks, Prof. Holmner unpacks the dangers of data misuse, algorithmic bias, and information inequality. She highlights how AI systems, while powerful, can replicate societal prejudices, leak sensitive data, and exacerbate digital divides.\n\nThrough the lens of ubuntu and African values of fairness and transparency, this talk calls for a responsible, context-sensitive approach to AI development and usage. Attendees will walk away with a deeper understanding of ethical risks, practical recommendations for researchers, and the urgent need for policies that protect both individual rights and collective societal good in the AI era."
