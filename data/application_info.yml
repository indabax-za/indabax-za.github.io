  item:
    - question: How many people from a single group or company should attend?
      answer:
        "This is highly dependent on the nature of group's research and the individuals
        within. \n\nWe highly encourage everyone to (apply to) attend, but there are
        of course limitations in terms of space and costs.\nWe cannot guarantee everyone
        from a group will be able to attend, and we will be prioritising diversity of
        attendees from multiple\ninstitutes and groups, where possible. However, we
        encourage those that _do_ attend to showcase a summary of what \nthey learnt
        to their groups; our community extends beyond the confines of who can attend
        a single event!\n\nIf you would like to guarantee multiple spots and support
        a good cause (we're a non-profit by the way!), \n consider [**supporting us**](/partners)
        as the packages come with awesome perks!"

    - question: How do I improve my application?

      answer: |-
        Here are some tips to strengthen your next application
          - Keep spelling and grammar in mind; it’s one of the first thing reviewers notice. Did you notice "imporve" above.
          - Show that you are committed to learning more about machine learning. For example, if you've taken an online course (such as Andrew Ng's Coursera course) you should mention it (and if you haven't we would highly recommend doing so).
          - Talk about how you are already using, or how you plan to use, machine learning for your work or research.
          - Talk about how you are contributing to your local machine learning community. For example, do you organize meetup events, run lectures, or lead a study group?
          - Make sure you put plenty of effort into the application since this is one way for us to judge your interest in attending.

        **See more tips [here](/register/tips).**
    - question: I'm a postdoc, where do I fit in?
      icon: ti-key
      answer:
        "It depends on contract. If you're a lecturer, you should apply as an
        academic. \nIf you're mainly a postdoc researcher but struggling with funds,
        apply as a student (there's no harm in trying). \nIf you're a postdoc researcher
        and have a strong stable income, you should apply as an academic."
    - question: I'm not sure if I'm a good fit, should I still attend?
      icon: ti-hand-open
      answer: |-
        **Yes!** Give yourself every opportunity to succeed by applying in the first place.

        The IndabaX is an opportunity to grow, explore, and learn new things while meeting amazing people along the way. Diverse backgrounds complement the experience and benefit the group dynamics; each participant will have their own journey to share.
    - question: I'm not from South Africa, can I still attend?
      icon: ti-flag-alt-2
      answer:
        "**Yes!** The IndabaX is open to anyone from anywhere in the world.\n\nWe
        are committed to making the IndabaX accessible to everyone, and we will do our
        best to accommodate your needs. \n**However, please note that we are unable
        to provide travel or accommodation assistance.**\nIf you have any questions
        or concerns, please contact us."
