Our **partners** are more than just those established companies that give us capital. They are the most avid believers in our South African machine learning community. They are the startups pushing boundaries and expanding local expertise. They are the people who advocate within their businesses to do more. And succeed. Our partners help to grow the IndabaX year-on-year. They are involved in ensuring the conference is a success. They are innovators looking to try new things and explore experiments beyond the conference. They believe in the event, the organisers, the IndabaX community, the South African people, and the Deep Learning Indaba movement sweeping across the \~continent\~ world that sparks innovation and uplifts African **people**. Plus, it's all **tax-deductible**.
