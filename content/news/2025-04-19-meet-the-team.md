Yes we back with deep learning, one layer at a time, to building Africa's AI future

## The Indabaùïè 2025 organising committee

## Some of our visions for 2025 include:

For IndabaX South Africa 2025, we want this conference to be a spark‚Äîone that ignites a sense of personal responsibility and possibility in every attendee. We want people to leave feeling inspired not just by the talks, but by their own potential to make a difference through machine learning and the choices they make every day. Whether it‚Äôs pushing ourselves to do excellent, meaningful work in a master‚Äôs or PhD, having tough but important conversations with our families about the tools we‚Äôre building and using, or taking the time to deeply understand the technologies we work with‚Äîthis is leadership. Whether it‚Äôs stepping up in the workplace to be the person others turn to, or building that business we know needs to exist‚Äîthis is how change happens.

We don‚Äôt just need more leaders‚Äîwe need good leaders. Leaders who do the work, who take ownership, who serve their communities with courage, intelligence, and integrity. And that starts here, with each of us choosing to rise to that challenge. We want people to leave IndabaX 2025 not just inspired, but energised and ready to act.

Share success stories to show growth from contributions done by Indabax startups, etc and more workshops to share knowledge and understanding of AI models

To advance skills development in machine learning that equips emerging talent to shape the future world of work through the ethical, context-sensitive, and locally impactful application of AI.

Fun while learning. Focus on foundational concepts and increase the quality of outputs at the different levels. More collaboration between different sectors through projects and success stories. Continuous growth and impact in our communities

We believe the breakthroughs of tomorrow will not be led by lone geniuses, but by teams willing to work across boundaries, with humility, curiosity, and courage. We‚Äôre here to champion those conversations. To make space for engineers to sit with epidemiologists. For ethicists to challenge developers. For students to teach professors something new. Because that‚Äôs how real progress happens.

We‚Äôre not just here to learn, we‚Äôre here to lead. And leadership in this moment means building coalitions across disciplines, geographies, and lived experiences. If we do that, we don‚Äôt just innovate, we make a meaningful impact. Together.

Keep up the quantity, increase the quality üòä This year, let's build a tangible bridge between industry and academia. Practice needs to meet the theory, theory needs to be implemented!

We envision a more AI-driven companies and research labs, bold conversations on how industry leverages AI and how academia can fuel its growth. The use of AI agents showcasing the future‚Äîall driving African solutions to global impact

To create a dynamic and inclusive South African machine learning conference that empowers early postgraduate students by bridging the gap between academia and industry. Through engaging talks, hands-on workshops, and networking opportunities, we aim to cultivate the next generation of AI researchers and practitioners driving innovation in Africa.

Get more companies in the Cape Town AI ecosystem involved and more Industry speakers. More students hired for internships / full-time employment after DLIX

Through Deep Learning IndabaX South Africa, we envision creating spaces where communities, students, and researchers can break down complex AI systems, understand their inner workings, and build solutions that resonate with African contexts.

To help the incoming students have a strong foundation in Mathematical concepts, such as in the field of Linear Algebra and Statistics. We can prepare Notebooks to help teach the students. We feel this will help.
