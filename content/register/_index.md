We welcome students, academics, and industry professionals to attend the Deep Learning Indaba𝕏 South Africa - one of South Africa's premier Machine Learning gatherings and community-building spaces 🤝.

_"Indaba" is a Zulu and Xhosa word meaning "discussion" or "conference"_

The aim of the conference is to provide a practical introduction to machine learning for beginners, to exchange scientific knowledge amongst researchers, and showcase cutting-edge applications from industry partners.

As much as we want everyone to join us, there is limited space available so we can only allow **\~300 attendees** in order to maximise their experience 🏫.

> **Note:** we will have videographers and photographers at the event 📷, smiles encouraged 😃.
