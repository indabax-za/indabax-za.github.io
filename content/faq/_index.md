The accommodation is at [Fuller Hall](https://stayandconnect.uct.ac.za/album/fuller-hall), which is a 5 minute walk from the venue.

## Funding

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-brazilian-real-sign">}} &nbsp; **How much does it cost to _attend_ the Indabaùïè?** {.faq-item}

The Indabaùïè is free to attend if you applied and are accepted. There are [paid registration options](/register) for academics and industry professionals.

Speakers have their fees waived.

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-sack-dollar">}} &nbsp; **How much does it cost the Indabaùïè per person?** {.faq-item}

Each person we have at the event costs the Indabaùïè ~R2000. Considering we have 400 people, this is a lot of money. We are very grateful to our [partners](/partners) for making this possible.

As a community-orientated event, we are committed to making the Indabaùïè as accessible as possible. We have a number of travel grants available to help people attend the Indabaùïè. These are allocated at **application time**. See [/register/travel-grants/](/register/travel-grants/) for more.

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-piggy-bank">}} &nbsp; **Can I get funding to attend the Indabaùïè?** {.faq-item}

We have a limited number of travel grants that have awarded to applicants. These are allocated at **application time**. See [/register/travel-grants/](/register/travel-grants/) for more.

One of the hardest decisions we make is allocating finite resources to infinite passion. We wish we could fund everyone, but we can't. We are very grateful to our [partners](/partners) for making any of this possible.

If you **need** funding to attend, but did not get one this year, the best thing you can do is to apply again next year. We will be around and rotating the event across our beautiful country, and we will be trying our best to make the Indabaùïè as accessible as possible.

#### {{<icon "ti-infinite">}} &nbsp; **How can I support the Indabaùïè?** {.faq-item}

If you are an organisation, consider [partnering](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGhOjWp5g8/UWA9vZ4-8PWMpwWFlBD6Iw/view?utm_content=DAGhOjWp5g8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h5896a6be6f) with us to gain more visibility and support the Indabaùïè. If you are an individual, attending through [paid registration options](/register) is also beneficial. If you are feeling particularly benevolent, consider [donating](https://www.payfast.co.za/donate/go/deeplearningindabaxsouthafricanpc).

Additionally, consider helping organise the event, volunteering at the event, shouting about the event, or just being a good human being.
