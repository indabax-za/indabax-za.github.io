## General

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-clock">}} &nbsp; **I'm arriving late on Tuesday, can I still register on Wednesday?** {.faq-item}

Yes! Come early (8am) to register on the Wednesday morning.

<!-- 
#### {{<icon "ti-home">}} &nbsp; **I have a travel grant or have booked accommodation through the IndabaX to stay at Wits, where is it?** {.faq-item}

The accommodation is at [Fuller Hall](https://stayandconnect.uct.ac.za/album/fuller-hall), which is a 5 minute walk from the venue.

Directions can be found [here](https://goo.gl/maps/muCMEK64Sbo165Kn9).

Check-in is 24/7. Please bring your IndabaX name badge, ID or passport to check-in. -->

## Funding

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-brazilian-real-sign">}} &nbsp; **How much does it cost to _attend_ the Indaba𝕏?** {.faq-item}

The Indaba𝕏 is free to attend if you applied and are accepted. There are [paid registration options](/register) for academics and industry professionals.

Speakers have their fees waived.

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-sack-dollar">}} &nbsp; **How much does it cost the Indaba𝕏 per person?** {.faq-item}

Each person we have at the event costs the Indaba𝕏 ~R1750. Considering we have 400 people, this is a lot of money. We are very grateful to our [partners](/partners) for making this possible.

As a community-orientated event, we are committed to making the Indaba𝕏 as accessible as possible. We have a number of travel grants available to help people attend the Indaba𝕏. These are allocated at **application time**. See [/register/travel-grants/](/register/travel-grants/) for more.

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-piggy-bank">}} &nbsp; **Can I get funding to attend the Indaba𝕏?** {.faq-item}

We have a limited number of travel grants that have awarded to applicants. These are allocated at **application time**. See [/register/travel-grants/](/register/travel-grants/) for more.

One of the hardest decisions we make is allocating finite resources to infinite passion. We wish we could fund everyone, but we can't. We are very grateful to our [partners](/partners) for making any of this possible.

If you **need** funding to attend, but did not get one this year, the best thing you can do is to apply again next year. We will be around and rotating the event across our beautiful country, and we will be trying our best to make the Indaba𝕏 as accessible as possible.

#### {{<icon "ti-infinite">}} &nbsp; **How can I support the Indaba𝕏?** {.faq-item}

If you are an organisation, consider [partnering](/partner) with us to gain more visibility and support the Indaba𝕏. If you are an individual, attending through [paid registration options](/register) is also beneficial. If you are feeling particularly benevolent, consider [donating](https://www.payfast.co.za/donate/go/deeplearningindabaxsouthafricanpc).

Additionally, consider helping organise the event, volunteering at the event, shouting about the event, or just being a good human being.

Each **evening** will have an activity with some food and drinks provided, but in limited quantities and not intended as a full dinner experience. We **strongly** encourage you to make friends and go explore the city for dinner.

## Safety

Johannesburg is a beautiful city, but like any city, it has its problems. We recommend that you take the same precautions as you would in any other city.

The University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) has security guards on campus and 24/7 CCTV footage.

Security contacts on campus:

* East Campus (Matrix, Great Hall, pedestrian and car entrances): [(011) 717 4444](tel:0117174444)

## Time

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-clock">}} &nbsp; **When should I arrive/leave Johannesburg for the Indaba𝕏?** {.faq-item}

We suggest arriving the day before the Indaba𝕏 starts (i.e. the 8th of July) and leaving the day after the Indaba𝕏 ends (i.e. the 13th of July).

#### {{<icon "ti-bag">}} &nbsp; **How packed is the schedule?** {.faq-item}

Very. We have an awesome selection of speakers and activities to fill up the time from ~8:30 am until 5 pm and beyond each day. The evening activities are normally optional, but we highly recommend you attend them for the full experience. Remember to take time for yourself, and to explore the city and surrounds.
