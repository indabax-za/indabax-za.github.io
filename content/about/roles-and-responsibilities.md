## 🤝 Shared Expectations
* We are here to grow the community, not elevate ourselves above others. 
* If someone is not pulling their weight, there will be a warning, group intervention, then eventually they will be removed from the team. No time (or acknowledgement) for slackers 🙅
* The IndabaX organising committee is not a soapie or a drama. This is an action-comedy!
