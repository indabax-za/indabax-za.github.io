Quantum Machine Learning
Two of the most exciting topics in the current tech-world are Machine Learning and Quantum Computing. In this talk, we combine the two oft-hyped topics and explore how Quantum Computing might be used to speed-up Machine Learning. Besides offering faster training times for certain classical algorithms, we touch on one known example where Quantum Machine Learning may even achieve insights unreachable (complexity-wise) by classical computers. In an attempt to de-hype the topic we mention some of the limitations and practical stumbling blocks of Quantum Computing. On an optimistic note, we introduce the IBM Q Experience which offers free access to a functioning Quantum Computer on the IBM Cloud, complete with graphical interface, an SDK and cloud-API calls.
