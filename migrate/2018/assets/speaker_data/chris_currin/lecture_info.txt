Artificial Assistants: How can I help you?
Chatbots are not equal; with different forms permeating our lives more and more. Virtual assistants are increasingly relevant for businesses and our day-to-day lives. Chatbots have become ubiquitous for interactions, yet ‘reasonable’ intelligence remains elusive.
In this talk, we explore and explain their underlying architectures and capabilities to understand what makes them work, their weaknesses, and future improvements.
Design principles from a technology and human perspective will be disseminated with examples of current production systems and their impact. Furthermore, the audience will have the opportunity to advance these best practices.
Resources will be made available, so the technology is relevant, practical, and accessible.
