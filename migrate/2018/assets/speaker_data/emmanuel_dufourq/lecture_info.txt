Facial Expression Recognition and Convolutional Neural Networks
We use facial expressions to convey happiness, sadness and many other emotions. Humans are good at understanding these universal expressions, however, this is non-trivial for a machine. These has not yet been significant effort at challenging the existing literature and to critically analyse what has been done and what should be improved upon in future research. In this talk we will discover what has been done in this field with respect to each primary aspect of pre-processing, building, training and evaluating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for facial expression recognition (FER). The talk is targeted to those who wish to learn about the theoretical aspects to be considered when implementing a CNN from scratch for FER. No background knowledge in FER is required.
