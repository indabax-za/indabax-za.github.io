Bayesian Networks

Deep learning methods has enjoyed a tremendous amount of growth over recent years due to architectural and algorithmic innovations; larger datasets; growth in performance of processors; software innovations; and increased investment from industry. Although deep learning systems provide outstanding performance on many benchmark tasks, they are often data hungry; require a significant amount of computer resources; are poor at representing uncertainty; non-trivial to incorporate prior knowledge; easily fooled by adversarial examples; finicky to optimise; and are seen as uninterpretable black-boxes.

Probabilistic graphical models is the current method-of-choice to address these issues. In this talk we will explore the Bayesian network which is a celebrated model for prediction under uncertainty; incorporates prior knowledge easily; used to express relational decisions (influence diagrams); and can provide powerful performance while being mindful about dataset sizes. The Bayesian network models the Bayesian paradigm which states that anything which we have uncertainty over we must maintain a distribution over.  We will explore the representation, inference, and learning of these networks as well as present some trending software which can be used to execute these powerful graphical models on real datasets.
